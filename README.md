# Noviq

Noviq- The name Noviq is make up of two words: Nova(which means new) and unique.

- So, Nova + unique = Noviq.

**Noviq** = **Nova** (new) + **unique**- Noviq is just a simple interpreted programming language writtin in Rust which aims to be independent in the future, i.e, being writtin in Noviq itself similar to how rust does it.

A simple, interpreted programming language written in Rust with a focus on clarity and ease of use.
A language written to have an easy syntax and high performance.

Noviq aims to be a compiled language instead of an interpreted language in the future.
