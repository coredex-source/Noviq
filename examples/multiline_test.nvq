# Multi-line Statement Test
# This file demonstrates that Noviq now supports multi-line if statements

x = 10

# Single-line if statement (still works)
if(x > 5){display("x is greater than 5")}

# Multi-line if statement with one line of code
if(x > 5){
    display("x is still greater than 5")
}

# Multi-line if statement with multiple lines
if(x == 10){
    display("x equals 10")
    display("This is the second line")
    display("And this is the third line")
}

# Multi-line if-else (else must be on same line as closing brace)
age = 25
if(age >= 18){
    display("You are an adult")
    display("You can vote")
} else {
    display("You are a minor")
    display("Wait a few more years")
}

# Simple nested if
score = 85
if(score >= 80){
    display("Grade: B or better")
    if(score >= 90){
        display("Actually, it's an A!")
    }
}

display("All tests passed!")
